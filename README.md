# Rockburg
Rockburg is a music industry simulation game that I've had brewing in my ([@Shpigford](https://twitter.com/Shpigford)) head for years.

Back in the early 2000's I was super in to this game called Project Rockstar and it met an untimely death thanks to trademark issues with their name. Poor guys.

Ultimately what I'm trying to do here is build a fun, modern simulation game. I have no idea what I'm doing, so all input is more than welcome!
